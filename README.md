    <p>Forms are a part of everyday life. When we use a physical form in real 
    life, we write down information and give it to someone to process. 
    Think of the times you’ve had to fill out information 
    for various applications like a job, or a bank account, or dropped off a 
    completed suggestion card — each instance is a form!

Just like a physical form, an HTML <form> element is responsible for collecting 
information to send somewhere else. Every time we browse the internet we come into contact with 
many forms and we might not even realize it. There’s a good chance that if you’re typing into a 
text field or providing an input, the field that you’re typing into is part of a form!</p>
